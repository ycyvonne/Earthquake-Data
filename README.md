# DBProject2

## TODO:
- add more properties (e.g. magnitude, range, etc) to each
  earthquake div.  add visualizations for certain properties.
- set up so that when a user clicks on an earthquake div
  (or hovered over, etc), that earthquake's map marker is activated
- make it pretty

## Ideal, but probably won't have time:
- make map responsive using responsive JS (i.e. using .matchMedia)
