# DBProject2

##Overview
- locations of earthquakes on Google maps
- bar graph showing magnitudes and locations of earthquakes

## Ideal, but probably won't have time:
- set up so that when a user clicks on a bar on the graph
  (or hovered over, etc), that earthquake's map marker is activated
- make map responsive using responsive JS (i.e. using .matchMedia)
